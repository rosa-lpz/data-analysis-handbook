# What is Power Query?

Power Query is a data transformation and data preparation engine. Power  Query comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query editor for applying transformations. Because the engine  is available in many products and services, the destination where the  data is stored depends on where Power Query is used. Using Power Query,  you can perform the extract, transform, and load (ETL) processing of  data.

## How Power Query helps with data acquisition

Business users spend up to 80 percent of their time on data  preparation, which delays the work of analysis and decision-making.  Several challenges contribute to this situation, and Power Query helps  address many of them.

 

| Existing challenge                                           | How does Power Query help?                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Finding and connecting to data is too difficult              | Power Query enables connectivity to a wide range of data sources, including data of all sizes and shapes. |
| Experiences for data connectivity are too fragmented         | Consistency of experience, and parity of query capabilities over all data sources. |
| Data often needs to be reshaped before consumption           | Highly interactive and intuitive experience for rapidly and iteratively building queries over any data source, of any size. |
| Any shaping is one-off and not repeatable                    | When using Power Query to access and transform data, you define a  repeatable process (query) that can be easily refreshed in the future to get up-to-date data.  In the event that you need to modify the  process or query to account for underlying data or schema changes, you  can use the same interactive and intuitive experience you used when you  initially defined the query. |
| Volume (data sizes), velocity (rate of change), and variety (breadth of data sources and data shapes) | Power Query offers the ability to work against a subset of the  entire data set to define the required data transformations, allowing  you to easily filter down and transform your data to a manageable size.  Power Query queries can be refreshed manually or by taking advantage of  scheduled refresh capabilities in specific products (such as Power BI)  or even programmatically (by using the Excel object model).  Because  Power Query provides connectivity to hundreds of data sources and over  350 different types of data transformations for each of these sources,  you can work with data from any source and in any shape. |



# Power Query M formula language

Microsoft Power Query provides a powerful data import experience that encompasses many  features. Power Query works with desktop Analysis Services, Excel, and  Power BI workbooks, in addition to many online services, such as Fabric, Power BI service, Power Apps, Microsoft 365 Customer Insights, and  more. A core capability of Power Query is to filter and combine, that  is, to mash-up data from one or more of a rich collection of supported  data sources. Any such data mashup is expressed using the Power Query M  formula language. The M language is a functional, case sensitive  language similar to F#.
